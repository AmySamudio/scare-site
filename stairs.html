<h1>Stairs</h1>
<p>In 1984, there lived an old widowed lady by herself in a two 
story house who was completely immobile and bound to her wheelchair. 
Ever since the mysterious death of her husband, she required the 
aid of a carer who would visit her daily to help her with everyday 
tasks. What made it even more difficult, was the fact that the two 
floors of the house were only connected by an old staircase inside. 
When the old lady needed to move between the two, the carer would have 
to carry her frail body like an infant, up and down the stairs. One day 
the police received a call from the widow. There had been a murder.</p>
<p>Since police units were scarce at the time, and the murderer had 
already fled the scene, only one detective was sent out to conduct 
the initial crime scene report. He arrived to see the carer's body 
splayed out on the floor with her vocal chords ripped out in a pool 
of blood on the first level of the house, with the old lady atop the 
staircase in her wheelchair watching him, still and silently, seemingly 
in shock. He could immediately rule her out as a suspect, due to her 
inability to move up and down the stairs, and because she was trapped 
up there the time the murder took place. It was similar to the death 
of her husband many years ago, who had suffocated in his sleep on the 
couch downstairs.</p>
<p>The detective put on his gloves, took photos, swabbed for evidence, 
and covered the body until the coroner arrived later â€“ all routine 
business. He scoped the house downstairs for any clues, then asked the 
old lady if he could look upstairs. She insisted that she was upstairs 
the whole time and no one apart from her had been up there that day, but 
regardless of this the detective ascended the staircase to which she 
hesitantly moved aside.</p>
<p>Beyond the staircase, there was a narrow corridor, with three 
closed doors along it. He checked behind each of the doors, the empty 
bedroom - nothing, the bathroom- nothing. He became anxious as he slowly 
made his way to the final bedroom where the old lady slept. He opened 
it and everything looked normal. A bed, a wardrobe and a bedside table 
with a lamp. He checked every wall of the room in horror, as it was not 
what he discovered, but it was what he didn't discover that made him 
stop dead in his tracks and slowly reach for his gun in its holster. 
It was a detail so minor that they had completely overlooked it on the 
last investigation of the husband's death. There was no phone upstairs. 
He suddenly heard a noise as he withdrew his gun and rushed out of the 
room, only to find an empty wheelchair atop the stairs.</p>
