<h1>The Wrong Parents</h1>
<p>When I was little, I used to wake up in the middle of the night 
and go into my parent's room and sleep next to my mom. One night 
when I was about 5 or 6, I had this really really vivid dream where 
I woke up scared, and went into my mom's room to sleep with her. 
When I went in, however, there were a set of parents on the bed, 
and a set of identical parents on the floor. I instinctively knew 
in my dream that I had to wake the right parents, because the wrong 
parents were evil. So I chose the parents on the floor. I distinctly 
remember thinking that the evil imposter parents would try to trick 
me, so I chose the parents on the floor. When I went over to the 
parents on the floor, they both opened their eyes, and where their 
eyeballs should have been, it was just bright glowing red light. That 
was when I actually woke up. Being a scared little kid, I of course 
went right into my parent's room to sleep next to my mom.</p>
<p>There was a set of parents on the bed, and a set of parents on 
the floor.</p>
<p>I literally pissed myself.</p>
<p>The "second set" of parents was actually a pile of unfolded 
laundry. But I will never forget the fear that struck my little 
6 year old heart at that very minute.</p>
